== essential point of views

. Sokol(not support Vulkan) and BGFX(too generic and fledged)
. Raptor Engine is based on Hydra Engine(small & simple, familliarity, vulkan, modularized)
.. layer based, means a layer can only interact with lower ones to simplify api design
... each chapter has its one implementations of graphics layer
. Raptor's 3 layers
.. foundation
... mem alloc
... containers: array(explicit allocator needed), hashmap(abseil)
... file: file operations
... serialization: fundamental step, also call asset baking, speed up loading files
... logging
... string processing: efficiently store and track inside a contiguous & fix-sized chunk of mem
... time management
... process execution: running external programs
.. graphics: GpuDevice is main class
.. application
. 

== questions

. is it necessary to write mem allocator by self instead of 3rd party's? tlsf?
.. ref: game engine architecture 3ed - 6.2
... Loki(modern C++ Design), Folly, Boost
. serialization, why & how, in detail
. customizing string? still necessary nowadays?
. can time.cpp be replaced by std::high_resolution_clock? 
. process execution, why & how, still necessary nowadays?
